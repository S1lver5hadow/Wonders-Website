        In a tropical mountain forest 2430m above sea level stands the Lost Incan City of Machu Picchu. It was thought to have been constructed around 1450 AD however new emerging evidence
        shows that it's possible it was active much earlier than that. In the past, it was an estate for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti and had 750 people living there as servants. Now it stands
        as a famous tourist destination and has been used as a set in filming both movies and songs.
