        The Great Wall Of China describes a wall that stretches across the northern borders of ancient Chinese states for protection. The walls themselves were built across different dynasties
        who would maintain and add to the wall as needed. Its uses were not only limited to defence, maintaining and regulating trade was a major use of the walls in the past. Today much
        of the wall is in disrepair with only roughly 20% suitable for tourism. Despite this, it still remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in China and is a wonder of the world.
