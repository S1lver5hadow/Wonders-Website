        The Romans are well-known by all and their amphitheatres are just as famous, among these The Colosseum stands out as the most popular one. In the centre of the great city of
        Rome lies a building made out of limestone, tuff and concrete that was built almost 2000 years ago. In the past the building held gladiatoral shows as well as other events. 
        Now The Colosseum is a major tourist attraction, a museum dedicated to the God Eros and finally a site for Roman Catholic ceremonies.
