        Petra is a city famous for its rock-cut architecture. It is one of the world's most richest and famous archaeological sites. The value of Petra lies in its tomb and temple 
        architecture. The way that Petra is built differs due to different civilisations succeeding each other meaning there is a range in building styles from prehistoric times to medieval
        times. The city was used as a trading hub before sea trade routes emerged, at which point it began to decline. Now Petra remains as an excavation site and a tourism landmark for Jordan.
